# Validation Crew Task Configuration

documentation_compliance_task:
  description: >
    Review the "ComputationalCrewDocumentation" output from the Computational Crew.
    Compare all documented outputs against the "InstitutionLegalChecklist" requirements.
    Verify strict adherence to legal and institutional requirements.
    Identify any abnormal details, discrepancies, or potential compliance issues.
    Flag items requiring human supervisor attention.
  expected_output: >
    A compliance checklist with pass/fail status for each requirement, and detailed
    comments on possible issues, discrepancies, or areas requiring human review.
  agent: documentation_compliance_checker

model_replication_task:
  description: >
    Using the documented hyperparameters from "ComputationalCrewDocumentation":
    1. Replicate the exact model training procedure
    2. Run training on the same training dataset
    3. Evaluate on the test dataset
    4. Calculate all performance metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, R-squared)
    5. Compare reproduced metrics with documented results
    6. Flag any significant discrepancies (>5% deviation)
  expected_output: >
    A summary table comparing documented outputs and replicated outputs with columns:
    Metric, Documented Value, Replicated Value, Difference, Status (Pass/Fail).
  agent: model_replication_agent

robustness_check_task:
  description: >
    Using the best model configuration from the Computational Crew:
    1. Load the 'train_drifted' dataset with synthetic variations
    2. Train the model on drifted data
    3. Evaluate performance metrics on standard test set
    4. Compare robustness metrics with original baseline results
    5. Assess model stability under distribution shift
    6. Document any performance degradation patterns
  expected_output: >
    Comparison of robustness performance with original results including:
    degradation analysis, stability assessment, and recommendations for
    improving model robustness if significant issues are detected.
  agent: robustness_check_agent

compliance_judgment_task:
  description: >
    Conduct comprehensive assessment of both Computational Crew and Validation Crew workflows:
    1. Interpretability: Assess model explainability and documentation clarity
    2. Legal Compliance: Verify adherence to institutional and regulatory requirements
    3. Conceptual Soundness: Evaluate methodology, assumptions, and theoretical basis
    4. Robustness: Review model stability under various conditions
    5. Synthesize findings from all validation agents
    6. Provide actionable recommendations for human supervisor
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive assessment report covering interpretability, legal compliance,
    conceptual soundness, and robustness with specific recommendations for
    addressing issues or making effective adjustments to the system.
  agent: compliance_judge_agent

comprehensive_documentation_task:
  description: >
    Compile all outputs from both Computational Crew and Validation Crew into
    a single comprehensive summary document:
    1. Executive summary of the entire workflow
    2. Computational Crew results and decisions
    3. Validation Crew findings (compliance, replication, robustness)
    4. Compliance Judge assessment and recommendations
    5. Overall conclusions and next steps
    6. Appendices with detailed metrics and logs
  expected_output: >
    "ComprehensiveSummary" - A complete technical and compliance document combining
    all crew outputs, assessments, and recommendations in a structured format
    suitable for stakeholder review and regulatory purposes.
  agent: validation_documentation_writer
  output_file: 'ComprehensiveSummary.md'
